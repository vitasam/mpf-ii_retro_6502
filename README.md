# MPF-II Micro-Professor 8-bit 6502 Retro Computer

**Microprofessor II** (**MPF II**), introduced in 1982, was Multitech's (later renamed [Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)) second branded computer product and also one of the [earliest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_II_clones) [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II) clones. It does not look like most other computers.

## Differences to Apple II
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprofessor_II)).
- The MPF II was not totally compatible with the Apple II.
- The MPF II did not have Apple II's text mode. All the text was drawn on the screen by software rather than generated by hardware. It was the only cost-effective way to generate Chinese text on the screen at a time when a hardware-based Chinese character generator could cost hundreds of U.S. dollars.
- Like Apple II, MPF II had two graphics buffers. However, the second buffer was at address A000H while with Apple II it was at 4000H. The keyboard input was mapped to a different address than the Apple II making impossible to play Apple's games on the MPF II.
- MPF-II keyboard interface was very simple and consisted of an 8-bit output port and an input port that was directly connected to the keyboard matrix. The Apple joystick interface was not there, and instead, the joystick appeared as a keyboard with arrow keys and two other buttons.
- The external slot interface was also not compatible with the Apple II and could not use any standard interface cards including the Disk II controller.

# Apple-II bus adapter and VGA-card
A custom VGA card for Microprofessor-II (MPF-II) computers, enabling high-quality RGB output to VGA monitors.  See [details of the project](VGA-card).

# BASIC Binary Data Loader, a Proof Of Concept
An  [experiment](BasicDataLoader) for loading binary data into MPF-II memory by using STROBE and BUSY lines of a printer port and Arduino microcontroller as a server:

# Backlog

- [ ] Add MPF-II support in to [c2t](https://github.com/datajerk/c2t) utility. `c2t` is a command line tool that can convert binary code/data and/or Apple-1/II Monitor text, as well as 140K disk images, into audio files suitable for use with the Apple-1 and II (II, II+, //e) cassette interface.

- [x] Modify MIC output level to be compatible with an input of [ZXTapeRecorderV2](https://trolsoft.ru/en/sch/zx-tapper). See [details.](Docs/Modifications/MIC_level)

- [ ] Add a volume control to the speaker (because the speaker is very loud by default)
